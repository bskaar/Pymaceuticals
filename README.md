Module 5 Challenge

Acknowledgements: Tutor - David Pecot for review of Pandas material specifically Module 4 which helped with grouping and aggregation of data in Pandas. I rewatched all three lectures and reviewed solutions to activities. I also leaned heavily on Pandas documentation, Matplotilip and Statiscal sub-package SciPy as had trouble creating the linregression line and found code [#from scipy.stats import linregress] to load that worked.
